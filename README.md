# Healthcare Analytics: Hospital Rating Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict hospital ratings based on CMS healthcare data. The analysis identifies key areas for improvement in hospital services, helping them enhance their ratings and overall patient care quality.

## Objective
To develop machine learning models that predict hospital ratings and provide actionable recommendations for underperforming hospitals to improve their ratings.

## Key Tasks

### Task 1: Understand the Data
- Perform data quality checks and exploratory data analysis.
- Visualize the distribution of hospital ratings and analyze them across various parameters (e.g., State).

### Task 2: Build Machine Learning Models
- Prepare data by removing unnecessary features, encoding columns, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Build at least three classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

### Task 3: Providing Recommendations
- Use the best model to predict hospital ratings for new, unrated hospitals.
- Provide improvement recommendations for hospitals rated low, focusing on significant quality measures (e.g., Mortality, Readmission).

### Task 4: Executive Summary
- Summarize the entire analysis process and present final recommendations in a detailed PDF document.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various hospital quality measures such as Mortality, Safety of Care, Readmission, Patient Experience, and more, provided by CMS.
